## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is designed to serve as a backend api that returns data from a MySQL database about various parks, and supports full CRUD functionality.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. MySQL Server [Mac](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914)/[Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919)
2. [.NET framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
3. An app that can send API Request, such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
4. A terminal, such as Powershell or Git Bash
5. A MySQL manager, such as MySQL Workbench (optional)
6. A code editor, such as VS Code or Atom (optional)

### Installing

1. To start, you'll need to acquire the repo, by either clicking the "Download" button or running `git clone https://github.com/Sudolphus/ParkService.Solution`
2. You'll also need MySql Server and .NET framework installed (linked above)
3. Once .NET is installed, navigate into the ParkService directory in your terminal of choice and acquire the necessary packages with `dotnet restore`
4. Install the database with `dotnet ef database update`. For this step to work, you'll need to update the {Password} in appsettings.json with your MySql Password
5. You can then build the project with `dotnet build`, or run the project directly with `dotnet run`
6. Once the project is running, you can send api requests using Postman or other requester (see below)

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once the program is running, you can interact with the database by sending api requests to `localhost:5000/api`.

For example, `GET localhost:5000/api/parks` will return a list of all parks in the database. For a full listing of available commands, see the [Swagger document](#swagger-)


## Swagger <a name="swagger"></a>

This program uses Swagger to document the available API calls. To access the Swagger page and see a full list of calls, please view `localhost:5000/Swagger` while the project is running.


## CORS <a name="cors"></a>

This program allows for cross-site scripting, so that the api can be called from any origin. To test this, you can use a site such as [Test-Cors](https://test-cors.org) to simulate a request.
